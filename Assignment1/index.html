<h2>What is CSS?</h2>
<ol>
<li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li><br>
<li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media.</li><br>
<li><span class  ="line">Css is not necessary</span>.<span class ="mark" >CSS saves a lot of work.</span>It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li><br>
<li class ="li4">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</li><br><br> 
</ol>
<h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Inline-by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
<li>Internal-by using a style element in the head section</li>
<li>External-by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
<li>The Most common wat to add CSS,is to keep the styles in external CSS files.However ,<span class="mark">in this tutorial we will use Inline and Internal styles</span> .because this is easier to demonstrate, and easierfor you to try it yourself</li>
</ul>
<p>When comparing CSS class vs ID the differenceis that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID,on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript</p>
<p>In CSS,selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page.Once an element has been targeted,a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
<p>There is a wide range of selectors available.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to
target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
